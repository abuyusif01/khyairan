# Drop Alpine.js from web package

## Description

Remove all Alpine.js references from `packages/web`. The architecture decision (bean khaiyran-l7m4) settled that the public site uses vanilla TypeScript — Alpine.js is reserved for the dashboard only. The existing scaffold still imports and uses Alpine. Clean it out so the web package has zero Alpine dependency.

## Related Code

- `packages/web/src/main.ts:1-5` — imports Alpine and calls `Alpine.start()`
- `packages/web/src/env.d.ts:1-7` — declares `Window.Alpine` type
- `packages/web/src/app.test.ts:1-21` — test uses Alpine x-data and x-text directives
- `packages/web/index.html:9-11` — `x-data` and `x-text` Alpine directives in markup
- `packages/web/CLAUDE.md:34-38` — layout section still describes "Categories / Brands" toggle from old Alpine design
- `packages/web/CLAUDE.md:57-59` — brand section still says "Navy + gold colour scheme"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `packages/web/src/main.ts` has no Alpine import and exports a no-op or minimal `initApp`
- [ ] `packages/web/src/env.d.ts` has no Alpine type declarations
- [ ] `packages/web/src/app.test.ts` has no Alpine directives (x-data, x-text) — test should verify the app module loads without error
- [ ] `packages/web/index.html` has no Alpine directives — plain HTML placeholder
- [ ] `packages/web/CLAUDE.md` updated: layout section reflects approved design (category-grouped, no brands toggle), brand section reflects white + green palette, stack section confirms vanilla TS
- [ ] `grep -ri alpine packages/web/` returns zero results
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with 0 errors and 0 warnings
- [ ] `npm run build` exits 0

## Tests

- `packages/web/src/app.test.ts` — `initApp does not throw` — asserts calling initApp() completes without error (no Alpine dependency)

## Summary of Changes

Removed all Alpine.js references from `packages/web`. `main.ts` now exports a minimal no-op `initApp()`. `env.d.ts` retains only the Vite client reference. `index.html` is plain HTML with no directives. `app.test.ts` verifies `initApp` runs without error. `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect vanilla TS stack, white+green brand palette, and the approved single-scroll layout design.
